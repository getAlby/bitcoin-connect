# 👋 Introduction

This project includes web components for connecting to Lightning wallets and enabling [WebLN](https://webln.guide). Websites only need to interface with WebLN to connect with multiple wallets, just like the Alby extension. However, no extension is needed to be installed - Bitcoin Connect is provided by the website. Users can connect from both desktop and mobile devices, using their favorite browser. PWAs _just work_. Bitcoin Connect's components work with pure HTML and all Javascript libraries or frameworks, such as React, Angular, Vue, Solid.js, etc.

🆕 Bitcoin Connect also supports a nice invoice payment UI that gives a multitude of options to a user to pay an invoice. Accept payments with a single line of code.

🥇 Bitcoin Connect won the [BOLT FUN Legends of Lightning vol.2](https://bolt.fun/story/legendsoflightning-2023-winners--1444) hackathon on 17 December, 2023.

🍯 Bitcoin Connect has some money for bounties. If you would like to contribute a new feature or add Bitcoin Connect to a popular webapp please contact hello@getalby.com.
